   <register acronym="KEYWRITEAREA" width="32" description="Key Store Write Area
This register defines where the keys should be written in the key store RAM. After writing this register, the key store module is ready to receive the keys through a DMA operation. In case the key data transfer triggered an error in the key store, the error will be available in the interrupt status register after the DMA is finished. The key store write-error is asserted when the programmed/selected area is not completely written. This error is also asserted when the DMA operation writes to ram areas that are not selected.
The key store RAM is divided into 8 areas of 128 bits.
192-bit keys written in the key store RAM should start on boundaries of 256 bits. This means that writing a 192-bit key to the key store RAM must be done by writing 256 bits of data with the 64 most-significant bits set to 0.

The data registers are typically accessed through the DMA and not with host writes and/or reads. However, for debugging purposes the data input/output registers can be accessed via host write and read operations. The registers are used to buffer the input/output data blocks to/from the EIP-120t.
Note: The data input buffer (AES_DATA_IN_n) and data output buffer (AES_DATA_OUT_n) are mapped to the same address locations.
Writes (both DMA and host) to these addresses load the Input Buffer while reads pull from the Output Buffer. Therefore, for write access, the data input buffer is written; for read access, the data output buffer is read. The data input buffer must be written before starting an operation.

Data registers for input/output block data to/from the EIP-120t.
For normal operations, this register is not used, since data input and output is transferred from and to the AES core via DMA. For a host write operation, these registers must be written with the 128-bit input block for the next AES operation. Writing at a word-aligned offset within this address range stores the word (4 bytes) of data into the corresponding position of 4-word deep (16 bytes = 128-bit AES block) data input buffer. This buffer is used for the next AES operation. If the last data block is not completely filled with valid data (see notes below), it is allowed to write only the words with valid data. Next AES operation is triggered by writing to the input_ready flag of the AES_CTRL register.
For a host read operation, these registers contain the 128-bit output block from the latest AES operation. Reading from a word-aligned offset within this address range reads one word (4 bytes) of data out the 4-word deep (16 bytes = 128-bits AES block) data output buffer. The words (4 words, one full block) should be read before the core will move the next block to the data output buffer. To empty the data output buffer, the output_ready flag of the AES_CTRL register must be written.
For the modes with authentication (CBC-MAC, GCM and CCM), the invalid (message) bytes/words can be written with any data.
Note: AES typically operates on 128 bits block multiple input data. The CTR, GCM and CCM modes form an exception. The last block of a CTR-mode message may contain less than 128 bits (refer to [NIST 800-38A]). For GCM/CCM, the last block of both AAD and message data may contain less than 128 bits (refer to [NIST 800-38D]). The EIP-120t automatically pads or masks misaligned ending data blocks with 0s for GCM, CCM and CBC-MAC. For CTR mode, the remaining data in an unaligned data block is ignored.
