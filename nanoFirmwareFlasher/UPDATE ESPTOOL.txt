Notes on Esptool

Esptool is available from https://github.com/espressif/esptool

Esptool folder (in the Solution) contains the required files to run the tool embedded on the nanoFramework firmware flasher tool.

** IMPORTANT **
All files have to be added to the project as embedded resources and marked as copy to output folder. Failing to set both will prevent Costura to add them to the tool assembly.

** Update Esptool **

When a new release of Esptool is available, the contents of the Esptool folder can be updated by running the update_esptool.ps1 PowerShell.
