# The title strings following the '~' symbols are families of JTAG targets. #
# The following values of 'legacy', 'modern' and 'alias' are the strings    #

# 1. The first character must be alphabetic.                                #
# 2. The later characters must be alpha-numeric or the '_' character.       #
# 3. The maximum number of characters is 16.                                #
# 4. The upper/lower case of characters is not significant.                 #
